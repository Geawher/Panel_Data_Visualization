# Panel Data Visualization

The web application presented here utilizes Panel and Plotly libraries to enable users to interact with a dataset analyzing student performance, and build a clustering model based on their performance.

Panel, an open-source Python library, provides a framework for building customizable web apps and dashboards. It allows users to link various widgets, including plots, images, tables, or text, to create interactive visualizations.

# Dashboards 
The purpose of this repository is to showcase the visualization of student performance in exams using panel data. It consists of two dashboards:

* The first dashboard is an exploratory data analysis dashboard.

* The second dashboard demonstrates the application of K-means clustering algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA) on the dataset, followed by visualization of the results.
